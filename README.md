# Fallen Kingdom

This is the repo for my final project revamped using Unity2D instead od GameMaker Studio 2

Originaly, this was created for ASU's CPI 111: Game Development I class final project, so I wanted to re-create it using Unity's tools.
Unity2D has more tools and a familiar environment personally, so I figured why not make a better game out of it!
